h1. Photoshop Scripts

These are scripts I've found useful for photo applications.

===========

h2. Charthrob.jsx
Useful for creating grayscale charts and calibrartin any print process like Cyanotype or Platinum Printing.

h2. AllMine.jsx
A quick smack on the File-Info block, marking Photoshop images with common tags.

h2. kbImport3.py
Not a Photoshop tool but a standalone Python script that can be used for importing images and videos and audio from
a variety of cameras and recorders. Before digital took over I had a filing system for media based on dates and projects. The kbImport tool allows me to keep a consistent filing system across different generations of cameras and has been used, in various iterations, on Max, Windows, and Linux computers.
