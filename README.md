# Photo(shop) Scripts

These are scripts I've found useful for photo applications.

===========

## Charthrob.jsx
Useful for creating digital negatives, calibration curves and charts for any print process like Cyanotype or
Platinum Printing.

You can find a Third-Party Guide to using Charthrob on inkgetnegative.com here:

## AllMine.jsx
A quick smack on the File-Info block, marking Photoshop images with common (for me) tags and copyright notifications.

(Classic "agglutinated over the years" coding style here: yeah, if I did it again I'd make objects for camera types etc)

## kbImport3.py
Not a Photoshop tool but a standalone Python script that can be used for importing images and videos and audio from
a variety of cameras and audio recorders. Before digital took over I had a filing system for media based on dates and projects. The kbImport tool allows me to keep a consistent filing system across different generations of cameras and has been used, in various iterations, on Max, Windows, and Linux computers. It will also convert some image filetypes (e.g., 'RW2') to Adobe DNG for efficiency and compatibility with some older image editors.
