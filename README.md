# Photo(shop) Scripts

These are scripts I've found useful for photo applications.

===========

## Charthrob.jsx
Useful for creating grayscale charts and calibrartin any print process like Cyanotype or Platinum Printing.

## AllMine.jsx
A quick smack on the File-Info block, marking Photoshop images with common (for me) tags and copyright notifications.

## kbImport3.py
Not a Photoshop tool but a standalone Python script that can be used for importing images and videos and audio from
a variety of cameras and audio recorders. Before digital took over I had a filing system for media based on dates and projects. The kbImport tool allows me to keep a consistent filing system across different generations of cameras and has been used, in various iterations, on Max, Windows, and Linux computers. It will also convert some image filetypes (e.g., 'RW2') to Adobe DNG for efficiency and compatibility with some older image editors.
