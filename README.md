# Photo(shop) Scripts

These are scripts I've found useful for photo applications.

===========

## AllMine.jsx
A quick smack on the File-Info block, marking Photoshop images with common (for me) tags and copyright notifications.

To personalize, just alter the fields in the "Person" object, right at the top of the code block.

This script can be used alongside the 'kbImport' file-organization tool: https://github.com/joker-b/kbImport

(Classic "agglutinated over the years" coding style here: yeah, if I did it again I'd make objects for camera types etc)

## ChartThrob

ChartThrob now has its own repo!
